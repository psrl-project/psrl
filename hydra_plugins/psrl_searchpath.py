"""Hydra SearchPath plugin that falls back to veRL's config directory.

When PSRL doesn't have a local YAML override for a config group (e.g., actor/actor.yaml),
Hydra will automatically load it from veRL's trainer/config/ directory instead.
This eliminates the need to manually copy and maintain veRL YAML files in PSRL.
